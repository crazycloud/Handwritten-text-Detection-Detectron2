## Handwritten Text Detection in Document Imgages 
We wish to detect the handwritten text in the scanned/pdf document. It could be for number of reasons like

  * to identify if the document has been signed
  * to process handwritten text in the document in a different way
  * to mask the handwritten text
  
Take following document image for an example. We wish to detect the text highlighted in the red bounding boxes.
